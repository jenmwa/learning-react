# learning-react

Trying to learn React so there will be some small projects in the makin'.<br><br>
here is a TodoList using Vite, React and Typescript.<br>
We have a form with inputfield, a submit button and a reset button<br>
When typing something and click add (or enter), the todo will be visible with a checkbox, the text the user wrote, deadline date (now hardcoded as 230630) and a remove button.<br>
You'll get a visible feedback when you check your checkbox, and you're able to remove the todo.<br>
<br><br>
future todo is to be able to choose a deadline date of your own choose, sort the list, and to save the list in localStorage.<br><br>
