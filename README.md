# learning-react

A collection of smaller React-project.<br>
We're learning React in school, so this will be my repo where I collect all of my different smaller assignment and projects.<br>
All using React, Typescript and Vite.<br>
<br>
So far:<br>
1. start-a-project : Just trying out everything at once...
3. FAQ-section for web.<br>
Rendering an array with Questions and Answers, the user will see the question, and if they click on the + they'll see the answer. Just click on the - to hide that section again.<br>
4. Quote-generator.<br>
Gives you an random quote every time you enter the page.<br>
Not liking what you get? Just hit 'Give a new Quote' button!<br>
5. Simple TodoList to try out props and dynamic css-classes.<br>
